# Automatic Audio Cataloguing Tool
### University Summer Project
Code repository for my university summer project **_Automatic Tools for Populating Graph Representations of Multimedia Catalogues_**. Very much a research project, the code takes an audio file like *this*:

### Prerequisites
* [OrientDB](https://orientdb.com/) database backend, preconfigured for FRBR-inspired audio ontology ([restore](https://orientdb.com/docs/2.1/Backup-and-Restore.html) from the backup `.zip` available [**here**](https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B4_JQ3-xFK6VTVNDTmNwR1pxYzg))
* [LIUM](http://www-lium.univ-lemans.fr/diarization/doku.php/welcome) toolbox (packaged `.jar` version)
* [Python 2.7](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-2714/)
* Packages as listed in `requirements.txt`

The code for this project has been specifically designed for use with the [Scottish Music Centre](http://www.scottishmusiccentre.com/)'s naming conventions, but will mostly work regardless of file naming protocol.

This project was undertaken as part fulfillment for my masters degree *MSc Software Developmet* from [University of Glasgow](http://www.gla.ac.uk/postgraduate/taught/softwaredevelopment/) during summer 2017. The project was supervised by [Dr. Bj√∏rn Sand Jensen](http://www.gla.ac.uk/schools/computing/staff/bjornjensen/) and was supported by the [Scottish Music Centre](http://www.scottishmusiccentre.com/) by way of use of their digital archive.
